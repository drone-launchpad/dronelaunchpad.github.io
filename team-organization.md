# **Team Organization Charter**

### **Team Goals** {#team-goals}  

1. **Develop a Functional Product**  
   - Create an **Automatic Drone Launchpad** that fulfills the technical and operational requirements for autonomous drone take-off and landing.

2. **Focus on Practicality**  
   - Ensure the product is practical for real-world applications by integrating useful features like weather monitoring for flight safety.

3. **Prioritize Safety**  
   - Implement systems to assess environmental conditions, such as humidity, to inform users whether it is safe to operate the drone.

4. **Ensure Usability through Testing**  
   - Refine the design through **user testing** to confirm it is intuitive and meets user expectations.

5. **Deliver a Durable Product**  
   - Build the launchpad with reliable materials to ensure it can withstand **frequent use** and **exposure to various weather conditions**.

### **Mission Statement** {#mission-statement}

Our mission is to revolutionize drone operations by combining safety, automation, and advanced weather analysis. With the Automatic Drone Launchpad, we aim to provide a seamless and intelligent take-off and landing experience for drone enthusiasts. By integrating real-time weather monitoring, including humidity detection, we empower users to make informed flight decisions, ensuring optimal performance and safety.

This project exemplifies how technology can enhance both practicality and innovation, pushing the boundaries of what autonomous systems can achieve. We aspire to inspire a new generation of drone products that are reliable, efficient, and intuitive, making advanced functionality accessible to all users. Our goal is to foster safety awareness while redefining how drones interact with the environment in modern airspace.

![ideals](https://github.com/omniscient-wizardry/omniscient-wizardy.github.io/blob/main/Images/Ideals.png)

The team came up with a concept different from the ones from the previous ideation. After choosing the sensors and components needed to fulfill project requirements the team realized the initial concept was not going to work. Initially, we wanted to make a device that was whimsical, and able to be taken hiking to give real-time data and predictions. 

Instead of going with an initial device idea, we decided to go with a device that can house a drone, gather weather data for flying conditions, and communicate that to the user. Some parts of the ideation process were taken into consideration when designing the device. It still needs to be weatherproof, and able to predict and communicate the data to a user, and we did try to keep the whimsical appearance.
