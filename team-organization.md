![ideals](https://github.com/omniscient-wizardry/omniscient-wizardy.github.io/blob/main/Images/Ideals.png)

The team came up with a concept different from the ones from the previous ideation. After choosing the sensors and components needed to fulfill project requirements the team realized the initial concept was not going to work. Initially, we wanted to make a device that was whimsical, and able to be taken hiking to give real-time data and predictions. 

Instead of going with an initial device idea, we decided to go with a device that can house a drone, gather weather data for flying conditions, and communicate that to the user. Some parts of the ideation process were taken into consideration when designing the device. It still needs to be weatherproof, and able to predict and communicate the data to a user, and we did try to keep the whimsical appearance.

| I should have purchased this unit first. Screen is very clear and easy to read. Maps of North America are accurate and up to date. Overall great unit for hunting and ATV exploring. | Ease in user interface, and clear screen. Visibility is the important factor. (Explicit) |
| the Garmin 67i is amazing\! I'm using it on my property in very thick and tall pine forest. Satellite reception and accuracy is higher than any other gps i've used. I was hesitant of purchasing this gps due to the cost. Now i'm so glad i did. Get off the fence, and buy it. You will not be disappointed.  You will need a bit of time to get used to or learn the menu features but all gps's have that in common. I will say that, in my experience, the 67i is the easy to learn and use. Of course, i'm not the expert and haven't used every gps out there, so take that advise for what it's worth. | Easy to understand interface. Product needs to be easily used and interpreted.

| Our unit is mounted just off the shoreline of Lake Ontario. It is exposed to severe weather and lots of variations of conditions. It has held up well and is extremely accurate. I did have an issue with the outdoor temperature and humidity not displaying on the screen. Customer service was very responsive with suggestions to resolve the issue.I have had spiders get in and spin webs on the rain collection arm. I bought this weather station because I had a Bresser brand that gave me connection problems and I wanted another one with another frequency.Positive aspects: the connection works perfectly, the data seems reliable, it seems more resistant than the Bresser, the screen is more beautiful with colors and lighting and it can be connected to the current so as not to waste batteries.Negative aspects: in comparison, it lacks many functionalities, it has a record of maximums and minimums but only for 24 hours and it does not specify what time and day it occurred. In addition, it does not have a record to see the data of the last 24 hours, that is, it only gives you the data of the moment. It will be delivered well packaged. The structure and installation are well described and easy to implement. The function meets our requirements. The screen is large and clear.What we can't predict is the durability of the outdoor unit. It's made of plastic. In our area (Andalusia/1000m) there is a lot of sun and strong wind. | Install protectors for outdoor sensors(explicit) Exposed sensors need to resist wear and tear(latent) The structure needs to be strong to withstand windy weather(latent) Data and parameters can be quickly fed back(explicit) Stable wireless connection(explicit) Rechargeable instead of disposable batteries(explicit) Displays need to be bright and durable(latent) Weather data can be stored(explicit) Instrument parameters can be adjusted manually(latent) Easy to assemble and operate(explicit) |

| The batteries in the outdoor unit will be very difficult to replace while on the roof. There is a small screw to remove that is almost guaranteed to fall down and roll off the roof, and then the batteries have to go up into the unit with the correct polarity, and you will have to lay under it looking up to see the installation direction. Battery replacement from the side would be a lot better. Amended to one star.  This weather station has pretty severe mounting limitations if you are mounting it on a "vertical" service. If this surface is vertical, you can only mount it on an east or west facing surface, as the mounting hardware included doesn't let you rotate the unit around to point the outdoor sensor in the correct direction. It certainly has a lot of functions (mostly useless), and my estimate is around a hundred. To pull up all this information, you have basically three buttons located around the edges, so be careful if you have to pick it up to read it or shift the rain gage scale. If you push the wrong button or push them in the wrong sequence, you could wind up erasing data. No menu and no help from the manual. | Internal parts are easy to replace(explicit) Large battery capacity(latent) The station can be mounted at any angle(explicit) The units can be rotated(explicit) All functions should be integrated and categorized(explicit) Wrong actions on system can be undone(explicit) The instruction is simple and easy to understand(latent) Longer life cycle(latent) |
