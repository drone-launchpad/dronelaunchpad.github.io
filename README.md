##  **Overview**  
The **Drone Launchpad** is an innovative solution designed to facilitate safe and efficient drone operations. It autonomously reads real-time weather conditions, including **humidity**, and notifies the user whether the current environment is suitable for flight. This launchpad ensures optimal flight safety by providing crucial environmental insights, helping users avoid unnecessary risks.

---

##  **Key Features**
- **Weather Monitoring:** Collects real-time weather data such as humidity, temperature, and wind speed.
- **Safety Alerts:** Notifies the user whether it is safe or unsafe for drone flight based on weather thresholds.
- **Autonomous Operations:** Supports automated drone take-off and landing.
- **Energy-Efficient Design:** Built with low-power components to ensure sustainable operation.

---
##  **Project Roadmap**
- **Phase 1:** Component selection and hardware setup.
- **Phase 2:** Sensor integration and microcontroller programming.
- **Phase 3:** Develop safety algorithms for weather-based flight permissions.
- **Phase 4:** Implement user notifications system.
- **Phase 5:** Final testing and deployment.
