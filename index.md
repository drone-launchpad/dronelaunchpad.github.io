## ✨ **Foreword**  
Welcome to the **Drone Launchpad** project. The goal of the Drone Launchpad is to allow the drone and the owner to understand their environment without have the need to directly interact with it. The launchpad has its own set of sensors to allow it to collect data which is then utilised to decide if the environment is flight worthy or not.
